# Tailwind-Demo

What is Tailwind?
 

 

Tailwind is a framework for building bespoke user interfaces, it has been designed from the ground up with customization in mind. By default, Tailwind will look for an optional tailwind. config. js file at the root of your project where you can define any customizations.

 

Why Tailwind ?

 


	
 No need for huge CSS les with custom CSS
	
 Easy to make design changes right from the view les
	
 Better developer experience
	
 Mobile-rst designs from the start
	
 Designed with defaults for a polished and designed look and feel
	
 Easily customizable with the config file


 


Tailwind comes with a suite of predefined directives, we’ve come across three in this article already:

 


	
the @tailwind directive which allows you to import the core of Tailwind
	
the @apply directive which allows you to create new classes by composing other classes
	
and the @variants directive, which we’ll take a deeper look at now
